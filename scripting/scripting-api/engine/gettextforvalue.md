This function can be used to get a nicely formatted string for display purposes. The days of `0.6999995` showing up in the slider's text display are finally over...

The function expects a numeric value and a mode name from a predefined list and returns a string that is formatted properly. 

> For a list of available modes take a look at the counterpart of this function, [Engine.getValueForText()](/scripting/scripting-api/engine#getvaluefortext)
