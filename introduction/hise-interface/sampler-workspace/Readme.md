With the **Sample Editor** you get a dedicated workspace for mapping samples in connection with a [Sampler Module](/hise-modules/sound-generators/list/streamingsampler). It shows your project folders opened in a [Filebrowser](/ui-components/floating-tiles/hise/filebrowser), and the connected Samplers [Sample Editor](/working-with-hise/workspaces/sampler-workspace/sample-editor), [Map Editor](/working-with-hise/workspaces/sampler-workspace/sample-map-editor) and [Sample Table](/working-with-hise/workspaces/sampler-workspace/sample-table).
