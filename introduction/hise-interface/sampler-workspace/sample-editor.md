The Sample Editor features a Toolbar, an Audio Waveform to display the selected sample and Value Setters to change the samples **audio-related** properties.


In the **Toolbar** you can find:
- **Zoom in, zoom out** Buttons for zooming into the Sample,
- the **Autoselect the most recent played sound** icon, to directly display the last played sample,
- a button to **Normalize the selected sample to 0dB**,
- and an icon to enable the **Loop Playback**.

You can drag and adjust the SampleStart and End (white overlay) the LoopStart and End (green) + LoopXFade when enabled and the SampleStartMod (blue) directly in the Audio Waveform display. If you need more precision you can use the Value Setters beneath the Audio Waveform. You can **right-click** on them to display a **big fat value slider**. 


> **Multiselection:**  **HISE** uses a global selection which can include multiple samples. The waveform will only show the last selected sample, where the Value Setters show the range of each property (the minimum value of any sample and the maximum value of any sample)
